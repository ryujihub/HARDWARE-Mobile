# Dependency Fix Todo List

## Completed Actions ✅
1. ✅ Add prebuild script to package.json
2. ✅ Clean node_modules and package-lock.json
3. ✅ Install dependencies with legacy peer resolution
4. ✅ Run prebuild to identify remaining issues
5. ✅ Fixed ESLint configuration conflicts
6. ✅ Updated deprecated packages (ESLint, Expo CLI)
7. ✅ Fixed missing imports (Alert in InventoryScreenMaterial.js)
8. ✅ Updated TypeScript version for compatibility
9. ✅ Fixed code formatting issues with Prettier

## Results
- ✅ Dependencies installed without peer dependency conflicts
- ✅ Prebuild completes successfully 
- ✅ ESLint/Prettier conflicts resolved
- ✅ Only 14 warnings remaining (mostly unused variables and React hooks dependencies)
- ✅ No critical errors blocking development

## Remaining Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
- 14 ESLint warnings for unused variables and React hooks dependencies
- These are code quality improvements, not blocking issues

## Notes
- Using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle peer dependency conflicts
- Clean install ensures no cached dependency issues
- Prebuild validates all native dependencies and plugins successfully
- Project is now ready for development and building
