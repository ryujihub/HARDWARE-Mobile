# Dependency Fix Todo List

## Completed Actions ✅
1. ✅ Add prebuild script to package.json
2. ✅ Clean node_modules and package-lock.json
3. ✅ Install dependencies with legacy peer resolution
4. ✅ Run prebuild to identify remaining issues
5. ✅ Fixed ESLint configuration conflicts
6. ✅ Updated deprecated packages (ESLint, Expo CLI)
7. ✅ Fixed missing imports (Alert in InventoryScreenMaterial.js)
8. ✅ Updated TypeScript version for compatibility
9. ✅ Fixed code formatting issues with Prettier

## Results
- ✅ Dependencies installed without peer dependency conflicts
- ✅ Prebuild completes successfully 
- ✅ ESLint/Prettier conflicts resolved
- ✅ Only 14 warnings remaining (mostly unused variables and React hooks dependencies)
- ✅ No critical errors blocking development

## Additional Fixes Applied ✅
10. ✅ Fixed Firebase v9 IDB module resolution issue in metro.config.js
11. ✅ Added React Native assets registry package
12. ✅ Updated to use new Expo CLI (@expo/cli) instead of deprecated expo-cli
13. ✅ Prebuild works successfully with new CLI
14. ✅ Fixed SegmentedButtons compatibility issue by replacing with Chip components
15. ✅ Updated InventoryFilters.js and SalesReportMaterial.js to use compatible components

## Current Status
- ✅ Dependencies install cleanly
- ✅ ESLint/Prettier working with only minor warnings
- ✅ Prebuild completes successfully with new @expo/cli
- ✅ Development server starts successfully with legacy expo-cli
- ✅ Firebase v9.6.11 IDB resolution working (Metro bundler starts without errors)
- ✅ SegmentedButtons compatibility issue resolved (replaced with Chip components)
- ✅ No compilation warnings or errors in web build
- ⚠️ Export/bundling has compatibility issues between Expo SDK 45 and newer CLI

## Remaining Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
- 14 ESLint warnings for unused variables and React hooks dependencies
- Export command compatibility issues (can use EAS Build instead)
- These are code quality improvements, not blocking development

## Recommendations
1. Use EAS Build for production builds instead of local export
2. Consider upgrading to newer Expo SDK (48+) for better CLI compatibility
3. Test Firebase functionality in development mode

## Notes
- Using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle peer dependency conflicts
- Metro config updated to resolve Firebase IDB module issues
- Project is ready for development and EAS building
